## What is BMI?

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m² where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m² is their height in meters squared.

### How to Calculate BMI

To calculate BMI, use the following formula:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2} \]

For example, a person who weighs 70 kg and is 1.75 meters tall has a BMI of:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{70}{1.75^2} = 22.86 \]

### BMI Categories

- **Underweight**: BMI is less than 18.5
- **Normal weight**: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
- **Overweight**: BMI is 25 to 29.9
- **Obese**: BMI is 30 or greater

### Significance of BMI

BMI is a useful tool to assess whether a person is underweight, of normal weight, overweight, or obese. It helps to categorize individuals based on their body weight and height, which can be an indicator of their risk for certain health conditions. However, BMI does not directly measure body fat and may not be accurate for all individuals, such as athletes with high muscle mass.

### Limitations of BMI

- **Age and Sex**: BMI may not accurately reflect the body composition of older adults or those who have lost muscle.
- **Muscle Mass**: People with high muscle mass may have a high BMI but not have excess fat.
- **Distribution of Fat**: BMI does not account for where fat is distributed on the body.
